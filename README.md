# Team Generator - An Employee Summary

This Node CLI takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Motivation

This application reflects a simple yet effective example of test-driven development, along with use of [ES6 Classes and Subclasses](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/es6-in-depth-classes/), HTML generation, regular expressions, switch statements, and more. My goal this week was to continue to utilize as much ES6 as possible throughout the application.

## Installation and Usage

Clone or fork the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/nabeek/employee-summary) and then run `npm install`

After installing, run the application with `node app.js` in terminal/bash. Realistically, there is no limit to the number of team members that can be added. An HTML file will generate in the output folder after indicating there are no more team members to add.

## Testing

Run `npm run test`
